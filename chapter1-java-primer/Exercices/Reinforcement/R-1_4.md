# R-1.4
> Write a short Java method, isEven, that takes an int i and returns true if and only if i is even. Your method cannot use the multiplication, modulus, or division operators, however.

&nbsp;

# Knowlegde from Binary
A number is odd only if the 0th bit is on. 

&nbsp;

# Solution

```java
public static boolean isEven(int i) {
    return (i&1) == 0;          // if i's 0th bit is 0 then returns true otherwise false
}
```
