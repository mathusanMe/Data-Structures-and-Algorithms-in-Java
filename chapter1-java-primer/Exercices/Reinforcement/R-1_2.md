# R1.2
> Suppose that we create an array *A* of *GameEntry* objects, which has an integer scores field, and we clone *A* and store the result in an array *B*. If we then immediately set *A\[4\].score* value of the GameEntry object referenced by *B\[4\]*?

&nbsp;

>:warning: Cloning an array is not about passing the reference to another variable.

# Answer
> Of course, it hasn't changed unlike *A[4]*.
